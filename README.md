# nodeBlog
A simple nodeBlog made using Nodejs, Express, and MongoDB (Mongoose).

# Run

To run, use the command:

```npm start```

# Features

Currently you can do the following:

- Create a new post
- Edit post
- Delete post
- And display/read all "published" posts

As I said it uses MongoDB as the database. To keep things simple, I used the popular ODM Mongoose for dealing with MongoDB.
